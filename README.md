## Overview

* Block-chain Baseball Cards is a demo app that won first place at Chicago's Baseball Hackday 2018.
* Open the console to see blocks added to the block-chain whenever a new user is created or a trade is initiated.
* Each user represents a miner. On every transaction the users each attempt to mine a new block in turn. The first user to successfully mine a block gets a reward. A piece of gum!
* A user can trade five pieces of gum for a new card.

## Installation

run `npm install`<br>
run `npm start`<br>
navigate to `localhost:3000` in browser

## Future Features

* Create a block-chain display component fixed to right side that shows each block as its added to the chain.
